        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable<br><br> content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is <br><br>that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web <br><br>page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for <br><br>'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. <br><br>Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on <br><br>purpose (injected humour and the like).

        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. <br><br>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, <br><br>when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make <br><br>a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, <br><br>remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the <br><br>release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more <br><br>recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including <br><br>versions of Lorem Ipsum.

        Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots <br><br>in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. <br><br>Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in <br><br>Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going <br><br>through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the <br><br>undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of <br><br>"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, <br><br>written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular <br><br>during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", <br><br>comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those <br><br>interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also <br><br>reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English <br><br>versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
